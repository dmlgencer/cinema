CINEMA PROJECT  
Cinema with Visual Studio (Windows Form Application)
In the Object Oriented Programming course, we developed a Windows Forms application in C# using Microsoft Visual Studio. 
In this project we created for movie theaters, we provided an interface where users can view movie theater data and buy tickets. 
We also integrated reading data from disk and selecting files using file I/O operations.
